# Happy Halloween. Welcome to Zombie Datasets.

The goal of this breakout group is to identify **“walking dead”** datasets, defined as: _“publicly available datasets which have been accessed least recently with relation to their peer datasets from the same source.”_

In this exercise, we will be playing [Dr. Robert Neville](http://imlegend.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_Neville_(film)) and treating these datasets as hosts infected with the _Krippin Virus_. This means, unlike zombies from the Robert Kirkman (_Walking Dead_) or Max Brooks (_World War Z_) universes, these “zombie” datasets are capable of being rehabilitated, **with the right use case**.

Upon identification of a zombie dataset, the team will work quickly to administer GA-series Serum 391, [Compound 6](http://imlegend.wikia.com/wiki/Compound_6). This means devising a use case for which the dataset could provide meaningful insights and, time allowing, creating MVP in order to demonstrate a potential application for the data.
